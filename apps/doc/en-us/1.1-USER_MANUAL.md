# MAA User Manual

## Features

### Operations

- If the stage you need is not available in the selection, please choose "Current/Previous" in MAA and manually locate the stage in the game, making sure the screen stays on the stage detail page with the "Start" button and "Delegate" command available.
  - If you are not on this page, "Current/Previous" will automatically take you to the last stage you played (according to the record in the lower right corner of the terminal homepage).
  - You can also enable "Manually input stage name" in "Settings" - "Combat" and input the stage number manually. Currently supported stages for navigation include:
     - All main stages, where "-HARD" or "-NORMAL" can be added at the end to switch between standard and challenge modes.
     - LMD stages and Battle Record stages 5/6, but you must input "CE-6" or "LS-6", and if unable to delegate at the sixth stage, it will automatically switch to the fifth stage.
     - Skill Summary, Shop Voucher, and Carbon Stages 5 must be input as "CA-5", "AP-5", and "SK-5" respectively.
     - Chip stages must be input with the complete stage number, such as "PR-A-1".
     - Annihilation must be input as "Annihilation".
     - Some event stages only support "OF-1", "OF-F3", and "GT-5".
     - The last three stages of the current SS event will have corresponding prompts on the main page after downloading updates automatically from the API (https://ota.maa.plus/MaaAssistantArknights/api/gui/StageActivity.json).


### Infrastructure

#### Shifting Strategy

Auto-calculate and choose the **optimal solution within a single facility**. Supports all general and special skill combination. Supports recognition of Battle Record, Pure Gold, Originium Shard, Chip, etc. for different operators.

#### Morale Threshold for Working in Infrastructure

Recognize the percentage of the Morale progress bar. When Morale decreases beyond some threshold, move the operator to the dormitory.

#### Note

- The shifting strategy is based on the optimal solution within a single facility instead of multiple facilities. Combination such as: `Shamare-Tequila`, `Vermeil-Scene` within a single facility can be recognized correctly; while combination like `Rosmontis`, `Pinus Sylvestris` among facilities is not supported yet.
- If `Usage of Drone` is selected with the option `Trading Post-LMD`, it will recognize `Shamare` and reserve it for her.
- Operators of corresponding fraction will be selected when only one Clue is needed Reception Room; otherwise general operators will be chosen.
- Reception Room will send out Clues only when your Clues are full. Three Clues will be send out at most. You can edit `SelectClue` - `maxTimes` field in `resource/tasks.json` to edit number of Clues sent if you want.
- If you do not want operators like `Irene` or someone else to be put into the dormitory when the training room is not in use, you can switch off `Working operator shall not be put into the dormitory` in the settings. Note that this may cause the operators with non-full fatigue not entering the dormitory as well.
- Due to the complexity of Control Center, only `Amiya`, `Swire`, `Kal'tsit`, `Team Rainbow` and other Morale+0.05 operators will be considered. To be improved in future.
- Some alternate operators may have conflicts in Infrastructure. Please notice if there is "Operator conflict" warnings on the UI, and double check the Infrastructure to shift manually (e.g. some facilities may not have any operator).

### Recruitment Recognition

- Auto-recruitment and recruitment recognition are two different features!
- Auto-recruitment supports using `Expedited Plan` to make it fully automated! Please set it in the settings.
- Pop-up notification when 5★, 6★ operators are recruited.
- Auto-uploading recruitment data to [Penguin Stats](https://penguin-stats.io/) and [Yituliu](https://yituliu.site/) while auto-recruitment.

### Integrated Strategy (I.S.) Support

- Supports recognition of operators and levels, and can choose an optimal solution of operators and skills.
- Supports recognition of shop items, and purchases items that are more valuable.
- Supports auto-reconnecting after disconnection, and replaying after 4 AM.
- The program will abandon the operation and retry if it is stuck by some bug. If it is stuck frequently at some place and has severe impact on efficiency, please submit an issue to us.

#### Create Tasks

- A tool for creating tasks is provided in the directory of MAA. See also: [Copilot Schema](3.3-COPILOT_SCHEMA.md) for help.
- How to get map coordinates: start an operation after filling in `stage_name`. A file named `map.png` will be generated for your reference. Or you can refer to [PRTS.map](https://map.ark-nights.com/), with the `coordinates` set to `MAA` mode.
- Drill plan is recommended for testing.
- Welcome to share your tasks with [www.抄作业.com](https://www.抄作业.com), or [www.prts.plus](https://www.prts.plus)!
- It is recommended to write your own name, video walkthrough URL, or other things that you think helpful in the description.

### Depot Recognition

(Beta) Please start with the `Upgrade materials` screen. Only exporting to several data websites are supported. More features will be added in future.
Please feel free to contact us if you hope to integrate with our JSON schema.

### Miscellaneous

- Tasks order can be changed on the UI. So can the shifting order in the infrastructure.
- Almost all configuration changes will be saved automatically, except for options containing an *.
- All clicking event is randomized within a region, following Poisson distribution (higher probability at the center, lower probability around).
- Developed in C++, the core algorithm supports multi-level cache, in order to reduce CPU and memory usage as much as possible.
- Our software supports auto-update ✿✿ヽ(°▽°)ノ✿ Beta-testers can try beta versions, which updates faster and less buggy (maybe).
- If auto-update fails, you can download manually and put the ZIP file under the same directory. The update will start automatically.

## Other Features

If you need to run multiple instances of emulators, please copy MAA folder, and use **the same ADB** and **different ADB addresses** to connect.
