# MAA User Manual

## Features

### Operations

- If the stage you need is not available in the selection, please choose "Current/Previous" in MAA and manually locate the stage in the game, making sure the screen stays on the stage detail page with the **Start** and **Delegate** buttons available.
  - If you are not on this page, `Current/Previous` will automatically navigate to the last stage played according to the record in the lower right corner of the terminal homepage.
  - You can also enable `Manually input stage name` in `Settings` - `Combat` and enter the stage number manually. Currently supported stages include:
    - All main theme stages, where `-HARD` or `-NORMAL` can be added at the end to switch between standard and challenge modes.
    - LMD stages and Battle Record stages 5/6. The input should be `CE-6` or `LS-6` even if you have not unlocked it yet. In that case, the program will automatically switch to corresponding stage 5.
    - Skill Summary, Shop Voucher, and Carbon Stages 5. The input also should be `CA-5`, `AP-5`, and `SK-5` respectively.
    - Chip stages. The input should be complete with stage number, such as `PR-A-1`.
    - Annihilation. The input should be `Annihilation`.
    - Certain side story stages. This includes `OF-1`, `OF-F3` and `GT-5`
    - The last three stages of the current SS event. This is available after downloading updates automatically from the [API](https://ota.maa.plus/MaaAssistantArknights/api/gui/StageActivity.json) when the event is on. Prompt will be shown in the main page when this is available.
- Fight options include `Use Sanity Potion`, `Use Originium`, `Perform Battles` and `Material`, you can specific any of them. The fight tasks stops once one of the specifications is met.
  - `Use Sanity Potion` specifies the number of sanity potions to use at most. Note that the potion is usually used one at a time which is the one default by the game client when current sanity is not enough for the next fight. However, Santity Samplers offer a smaller amount of sanity and thus might be used more than one at a time. Pay attention to this when specifying the number of potions to use.
  - `Use Originium` specifies the number of Originium to use at most. It is used one at a time.
  - `Perform Battles` specifies the number of battles to perform at most.
  - `Material` specifies the number of materials to collect.
- Note that `Material` and `Stage` are independent options which means the program is not going to automatically navigate the the stage for the specified material. You still to mannually configure the stage option.
- `Delegate` will be automatically selected if not already in case you forget to do so.
- Material drops are automatically recognized and printed to the program log. The data also gets uploaded to [Penguin Stats](https://penguin-stats.io/). You can also manually set your Penguin Stats user ID in the settings.
- If client drops offline(including at 4 AM), the program will automatically reconnect and resume the previous stage fight. This can be configured in the settings.
- A level up situation can be automatically handled as well as a failed delegation in which case this time of the operation will be given up.

### Infrastructure

#### Shifting Strategy

Automatically calculate and choose the **optimal solution within a single facility**. Supports all general and special skill combinations. Supports recognition of Battle Record, Pure Gold, Originium Shard, Chip, etc. for different operators.

#### Morale Threshold for Working in Infrastructure

Recognizes the percentage of the Morale bar. When Morale is below some threshold, the operator will be moved to the dormitory.

#### Note

- The shifting strategy is based on the optimal solution within a single facility instead of multiple facilities. Combination such as: `Shamare-Tequila`, `Vermeil-Scene` within a single facility can be recognized correctly; while combination like `Rosmontis`, `Pinus Sylvestris` among facilities is not supported yet.
- If `Usage of Drone` is selected with the option `Trading Post-LMD`, it will recognize `Shamare` and reserve it for her.
- Operators of corresponding fraction will be selected when only one Clue is needed Reception Room; otherwise general operators will be chosen.
- Reception Room will send out Clues only when your Clues are full. Three Clues will be send out at most. You can edit `SelectClue` - `maxTimes` field in `resource/tasks.json` to edit number of Clues sent if you want.
- If you do not want operators like `Irene` or someone else to be put into the dormitory when the training room is not in use, you can switch off `Working operator shall not be put into the dormitory` in the settings. Note that this may cause the operators with non-full fatigue not entering the dormitory as well.
- Due to the complexity of Control Center, only `Amiya`, `Swire`, `Kal'tsit`, `Team Rainbow` and other Morale+0.05 operators will be considered. To be improved in future.
- Some alternate operators may have conflicts in Infrastructure. Please notice if there is "Operator conflict" warnings on the UI, and double check the Infrastructure to shift manually (e.g. some facilities may not have any operator).

### Recruitment Recognition

- Auto-recruitment and recruitment recognition are two different features!
- Auto-recruitment supports using `Expedited Plan` to make it fully automated! Please set it in the settings.
- Pop-up notification when 5★, 6★ operators are recruited.
- Auto-uploading recruitment data to [Penguin Stats](https://penguin-stats.io/) and [Yituliu](https://yituliu.site/) while auto-recruitment.

### Integrated Strategy (I.S.) Support

- Supports recognition of operators and levels, and can choose an optimal solution of operators and skills.
- Supports recognition of shop items, and purchases items that are more valuable.
- Supports auto-reconnecting after disconnection, and replaying after 4 AM.
- The program will abandon the operation and retry if it is stuck by some bug. If it is stuck frequently at some place and has severe impact on efficiency, please submit an issue to us.

#### Create Tasks

- A tool for creating tasks is provided in the directory of MAA. See also: [Copilot Schema](3.3-COPILOT_SCHEMA.md) for help.
- How to get map coordinates: start an operation after filling in `stage_name`. A file named `map.png` will be generated for your reference. Or you can refer to [PRTS.map](https://map.ark-nights.com/), with the `coordinates` set to `MAA` mode.
- Drill plan is recommended for testing.
- Welcome to share your tasks with [www.抄作业.com](https://www.抄作业.com), or [www.prts.plus](https://www.prts.plus)!
- It is recommended to write your own name, video walkthrough URL, or other things that you think helpful in the description.

### Task Video Recognition

- Drag and drop the video file to the `Copilot` section and click `Start` to initialize the video recognition.
- Only 16:9 aspect ratio and 720p above is supported. Black bars, emulator sidebars, and others are not allowed in the video.

- Almost all configuration changes will be saved automatically, except for options containing an *.
- All clicking event is randomized within a region, following Poisson distribution (higher probability at the center, lower probability around).
- Developed in C++, the core algorithm supports multi-level cache, in order to reduce CPU and memory usage as much as possible.
- Our software supports auto-update ✿✿ヽ(°▽°)ノ✿ Beta-testers can try beta versions, which updates faster and less buggy (maybe).
- If auto-update fails, you can download manually and put the ZIP file under the same directory. The update will start automatically.
